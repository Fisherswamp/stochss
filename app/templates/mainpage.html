        <p>Welcome to the StochSS App v1.0! In this first version, we provide a <a href="/modeleditor" style="font-size: 20px;">Model Editor</a> to create new well-mixed stochastic models, or to <a style="font-size: 20px;" href="/modeleditor/import/fromfile" >import existing StochKit2 models</a> expressed in its native XML format.
        
            Once you have defined your model, we let you <a style="font-size: 20px;" href="/simulate" >run simulations</a> with StochKit2.
        </p>

        <h3>Want to run simulations locally?</h3>
            <p>
        To use StochSS to run StochKit simulations on your local machine, you need to install StochKit2.0.7. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/stochkit/" target="_blank">Download StochKit from Sourceforge</a> and follow the install instructions for your operating system.

        StochSS treats StochKit as a computational plugin, so once it is installed, you need to <a href="/localsettings">tell us where it is located on your computer.</a>  Note that it is not necessary to install StochKit if you only plan to use Cloud resources for your simulations.
        
        </p>
        </br>
        <h3>Want to run simulations in the Cloud?</h3>
        
        <p>
            StochSS will let you launch computational nodes in the Amazon EC2 compute cloud and use them to run your simulations, all with the click of a button! To use this feature, you need to sign up for an account with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> and then <a href="/credentials">enter your AWS credentials</a>.
