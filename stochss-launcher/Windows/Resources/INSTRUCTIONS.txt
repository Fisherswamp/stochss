Instructions for creating a new portable StochSS launcher: 

1. Export working .jar file to ./StochSS as Resources.jar
2. Settings, icons, etc go to ./StochSS/src
3. Download Java and install to ./StochSS/src/Java

4. Import launch4jSettings.xml to Launch4j. Change executable path to absolute path where /StochSS/StochSS.exe

5. All other settings should be fine, they're based off of the executable's path. Create executable.

6. If you test via Launch4j's run button, it'll generate a log if it fails. Delete log once done troubleshooting.

7. Compress into self-extracting .zip file

Instructions for Java-dependent StochSS launcher:

As above, but skip step 3 and in step 4 import launch4jSettingsJavaDependent.xml instead. 

Optionally update minimum Java version in JRE tab to whatever Java version was used in development, originally set at 1.8 in settings.
