The function 'convert(<directory to the sbml file>)' in converter.py validates a sbml file and converts it into a stochss model file in python. The generated file is in the same directory as the sbml file (windows (\) and linux (/) directories uses different slashes).
To run it in a command prompt, call "python converter <directory to the sbml file>".

The module requires libsbml.
